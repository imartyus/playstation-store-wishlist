# PlayStation Store Wishlist
Since Wishlist was deprecated in the recent PSN Store website update, this extension provides an alternative solution to keep track of the games you want to buy as well as their current prices.

You can check it out [on the Chrome web store.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/playstation-store-wishlis/mainmjalkbfolnepgbpilegkchonimdn)

**Features:**
- Easily add a game to your Wishlist by opening the extension on a product's PSN Store page and clicking add button
- The extension will keep track of your selections and periodically update the prices in the background
- Once one of the added games goes on sale, you will be notified through the extension's badge
- Clicking a game's title will take you directly to its PSN Store page 
- Sort your Wishlist by title or current price
